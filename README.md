# Blu:Gen

Blu:Gen is a sustainability-focused web platform designed to encourage better waste management and recycling behavior through thoughtful design, accessibility, and incentives. The project explores how digital interfaces and behavioral insights can be used to address real-world environmental challenges in schools and communities.

This repository currently contains the **front-end implementation** of the Blu:Gen platform.

## Project Overview

In many urban environments, waste-management problems stem not only from infrastructure gaps but also from poor engagement, unclear information, and weak incentives. Blu:Gen was created to address this issue by rethinking how users interact with recycling systems.

The platform focuses on:
- Making waste sorting and recycling more intuitive
- Reinforcing positive behavior through clear feedback
- Designing systems that are accessible to non-technical users

Blu:Gen is intended to be extensible, with future integration planned for data analytics, incentives, and physical waste-collection systems.

## Features

Current features include:
- Responsive front-end interface
- Clean and accessible UI design
- Modular layout for easy expansion
- Design informed by sustainability and behavioral principles

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

The codebase is structured to support future backend and database integration.
