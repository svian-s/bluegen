# Blu:Gen Backend

This repository contains the **backend code** for Blu:Gen, a sustainability-focused platform designed to support data handling, system logic, and future integrations for improved waste management and recycling initiatives.

The backend serves as the foundation for managing application logic, data flow, and communication between the frontend interface and external systems.

---

## About the Project

The Blu:Gen backend was developed to support the platform’s goal of encouraging better waste-management behavior through digital systems. While the frontend focuses on user interaction and design, the backend is responsible for structuring how data is processed, stored, and extended as the system scales.

This repository focuses on the **server-side architecture**, with an emphasis on clarity, modularity, and future extensibility.
